The painting was highly regarded
even when Leonardo worked on it,
Leonardo had the ability to closely
imitate nature. Indeed, the Mona
Lisa is a very realistic portrait.

The artist skillfully used
gradations of light and shadow to
model form. The delicately painted
veil, the finely wrought Mona
Lisa's hair, and the careful
rendering of folded cloth reveal
Leonardo's studied observations
and inexhaustible patience
‘Viewers today can appreciate the
sitter’s staring gaze and her
ambiguous smile.
